# ApproximatePi
Visualization of Monte Carlo approximation of Pi utilizing SDL2. Code was written quickly with the point being to quickly visualize the approximation algorithm (viewer discretion is advised).

ApproximatePi executable is available (this is a unix executable). Any OS not compatible will have to build the src files manually and link SDL2.
